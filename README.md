For Working Google GPS, you will need to have a Google Map API.
Selected APIs:
- Maps SDK for iOS
- Directions API
- Geocoding API
- Places API
- Distance Matrix API


There are 2 files that you will need to place your Google Map API in:
1. moblie_waste_manage/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift
2. moblie_waste_manage/lib/map_updates.dart


You will also need to connect to your firebase API.

After connecting to all APIs, you can run flutter command to run the app.

flutter run
